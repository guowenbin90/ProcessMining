# Process mining for python 
Coursera: [Process Mining: Data science in Action](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining)  
[pm4py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/) is a Python library implementing a variety of [process mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_mining) algorithms.

**Directly Follows Graph (DFG)**: The edge connecting the two events can be embellished with extra information such that how many instances were found to follow this edge or whatâ€™s the average time taken per instance to go from e1 to e2.  
**Heuristic Miner (HM)**: Find rules that the events follow. More specifically, the algorithm is able to filter out outlier edges and even detect when two events (such as sleepingand snoring) are concurrent.
